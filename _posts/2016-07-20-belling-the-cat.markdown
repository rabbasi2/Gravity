For assignment 6, we used html, markdown, pandoc and reveal. js. Reveal. js is a more advance have to give and create presentation. 
We decide to give our presentaion on an aseop's fable, Belling the Cat. The story is about mice trying to figure out how to deal 
with the cat because their number were decreaseing. The mice held a meeting and many ideas were proposed, but were rejected.
