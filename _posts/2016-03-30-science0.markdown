<p>
The second assigment for INLS 161 was to create a website. 
I used CSS, HTML and Markdown to create this site. It was confusing switching back and forth beteween them. 
But is was worth it because I learned three differnt langguages that are in some ways similar to each other.
Also this assignment enforced what we had learned in class.
