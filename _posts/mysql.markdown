title:  "Database and MySql"
--- 

This week we focused on  crating databases using MYSQL. With my group we created a short survey to collect data.
We used script to read the data and store it in MYSQL. Everything went smoothly until MySql only didn't run 
becasue the passwords didn't match.To solve this issue we aske the user for their mysql password and store that when
running mysql. [Here's the link:](https://github.com/rabbasi2/task-5-database-interface/tree/archive).

Hope you like it !! :smile:
