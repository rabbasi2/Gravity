This post is the third assignment for my INLS 161 class. For the assignment, I had to convert a orgianl Doucment to 
multiple formats using script. I chose a paper from my AAAD 214 class.

The paper is an analysis of a Witchcraft,Violence, and Democracy in South Africa by Adam Ashforth. In this Ashforth explores 
the Soweto Society and its reraltion to witchcraft.The paper is divided in to three parts. The first part is about the Social 
dimensions vs Witchcraft in Soweato.The second part focuses on cause of witchcraft and its orgin. The last is about 
witchcraft vs the government.

Below I have the essay linked in different formats. I used pandoc to convert the essay from markdown to HTML, DOCX, ODT and PDF. 
Also, I installed texlive because without it i Won't be able to comvert markdown to pdf format.
