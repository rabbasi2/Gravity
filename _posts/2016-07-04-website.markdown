I thought it be a good idea to post a poem about Hope since it is the Fourth of July.

  **Hope Will Never Die**
   
Life dies, Hope lives in people's hearts.

It guides us through our trouble times.

Without Hope we become lost 

and have no sense of directions. 

Giving up hope is not a question.

Love fails,

Friendship fails,

Hope keeps us going.
