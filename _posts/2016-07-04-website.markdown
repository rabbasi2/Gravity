I thought it be a good idea to post a poem about Hope since it is the Fourth of July.

   Hope Will Never Die
   
Life dies, Hope lives in people's hearts.

It guides us through our trouble times.

Without Hope we become lost 

and have no sense of directions. 

Giving up hope is not a question.

Love fails,

Friendship fails,

Hope keeps us going.
